This project is a web application that uses Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, to display real-time earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The application fetches earthquake data in GeoJSON format from the USGS API and visualizes it on an interactive map. Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker on the map, with the size of the marker indicating the magnitude of the earthquake and the color representing its depth. Clicking on a marker displays a popup with additional information about the earthquake, including the location, magnitude, and depth.

To run the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The map will load with the latest earthquake data from the USGS. You can zoom in and out, pan the map, and interact with the markers to view details about each earthquake. The base map is provided by OpenStreetMap.

This project demonstrates the integration of Leaflet, D3, and JavaScript to create an interactive data visualization. It showcases the power and flexibility of Leaflet for building compelling map-based applications. Feel free to explore and customize the code to fit your needs!
